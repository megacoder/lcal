"Lcal" Version 1.2

This is a new release of "lcal", the PostScript lunar phase calendar
program.  The major new features are:

      . a Y2K-related bug in the default year calculation has been fixed;

      . a man page has been added;

      . many program defaults may now be specified in the Makefile;

      . the Makefile has several new targets (read it for details);

      . the usage message is piped through a screen pager (Un*x only).

      . the -s flag (see below) allows the user to specify the background
	and foreground colors as grayscale values or red:green:blue values.

      . the -S flag (see below) prints a smaller, single-page calendar.

      .	the distribution includes .html and .cgi files for setting up an
	Lcal server using Netscape (maybe others; I haven't tried them)
	under Un*x.

Lcal generates a PostScript file which prints a two-page calendar showing
the phase of the moon for every day in the specified year.  This calendar
may be printed in either landscape or portrait mode (cf. -l and -p below).

Usage: lcal [-d|-t <FONT>] [-o <FILE>] [-l|-p] [-s {<b>}{/<f>}] [-i]
            [-z <VALUE>] [-S] [-X|-Y <n>{/<n>}] [-W] [-h|-u|-v] [YY]

	-d <FONT>       specify alternate font for weekday names
	-t <FONT>       specify alternate font for year/months/dates

	-o <FILE>       specify alternate output file (default: stdout)

	-l              generate landscape-style calendar
	-p              generate portrait-style calendar
	                  (default: landscape)

	-s {<b>}{/<f>}  specify back/foreground colors (grayscale or r:g:b)
	                  (default: 1/0)

	-i              invert colors (white moons on black background)

	-z <VALUE>      specify alternate time zone (default: 0)

	-S		compress output to fit on single page

	-X <n>{/<n>}    specify X offset (p.1/p.2)
	                  (default: 0/0)
	-Y <n>{/<n>}    specify Y offset (p.1/p.2)
	                  (default: 0/0)

	-W              print weekdays inside moons (warning: very slow)

	-h              print this help message
	-u              print usage message
	-v              print version stamp

	YY              generate calendar for year YY (19YY if YY < 100)
	(default)       generate calendar for current year


Notes:

  Some fudging of the -X and -Y flags may be necessary.  As shipped (-X0/0,
  -Y0/0), lcal will attempt to print the two pages so that the last moons on
  the first page are immediately adjacent to the first moons on the second;
  however, many printers can't actually print to the edges of the physical
  page.  If this is the case, tweak the Makefile as follows and rebuild:

	# specify local default X/Y offsets
	D_XOFFSET = '-DX_OFFSET="-20/20"'
	D_YOFFSET = '-DY_OFFSET="20/-20"'

  The time zone flag, -z, takes hours west of UTC (e.g., Boston = 5) as its
  argument.

  If the -s (or -i, equivalent to -s0/1) flag is used, lcal attempts to
  determine whether the background color is darker than the foreground color;
  if so, lcal inverts the moon phase to ensure that a full moon is printed
  in the lighter color.
  
  If desired, all flags except -[huv] may be specified in environment variable
  LCAL_OPTS.

Lcal was inspired by "Moonlight 1996", a 16" x 36" full-color (silver moons
against a midnight blue background) lunar phase calendar marketed by
Celestial Products, Inc., P.O. Box 801, Middleburg VA  22117.  Send for
their catalog to see (and, hopefully, order) this as well as some even more
amazing stuff - particularly "21st Century Luna", a lunar phase calendar for
*every day* of the new century.

The following is the original Pcal "ReadMe" file:


"Pcal" is a program to print PostScript calendars for any month and year.
By default, it looks for a file in the home directory named "calendar"
for entries with leading dates matching dates on the calendar, and prints
any following text under the appropriate day.

The program may be a little System V flavored (getopt, time routines)
but should be easily portable to other vintages of UNIX.

Pcal is the combined effort of several people, most notably Patrick Wood
of Pipeline Associates, Inc. for the original PostScript code and Bill
Vogel of AT&T for the calendar file mechanism.  My [Ken Keirnan's] part was
simple translation to a "C" program, the addition of a couple options and
a more generalized date searching routine (oh yes, and a manual page :-).
